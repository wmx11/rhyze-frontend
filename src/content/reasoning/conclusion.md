In simple terms, when a token is going up, people get FOMO. Look at PEPE, a token with no utility and no revenue, reaching almost a $2BN market cap at the ATH. People kept buying PEPE because the chart was green and it looked like it was never going to stop. Well, with Rhyze, the price will literally never stop going up! Imagine the potential!
